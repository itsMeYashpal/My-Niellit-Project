It is an additive measure that can be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives, and funding restrictions which are published annually.

What is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles, personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs, welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA's IHP unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA's Individual Assistance (IA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA's IA program response attributes. This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective and equitable recovery.                                                                        \n\nPlease note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location on the earth). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.

The HMGP provides grants to states and local governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on.

IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state, local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement, Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe. It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.

FEMA does not validate the content of each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.

For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information. This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after the official IPAWS message has been sent.

The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message.

Through effective mitigation planning and the implementation of mitigation strategies greater risk reduction can be achieved. State, tribal, territorial and local governments undertake hazard mitigation planning to identify risks and vulnerabilities related to natural disasters. Through planning, they develop long-term strategies for protecting people and property from future events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repeated damage.  A FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is required to receive grant funding. \n\nHazard mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments to:\n' Increase education and awareness around threats, hazards, and vulnerabilities\n' Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments, organizations, businesses, and the public\n' Identify long-term, thorough strategies and achieve risk reduction\n' Align risk reduction with other state, tribal, territorial or community objectives\n' Identify implementation actions to focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n' Connect priorities to potential funding sources\n' Increase investment in mitigation actions\n\nA FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance, including funding for mitigation projects.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate in multiple plans.

Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8 (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic forms within FEMA's financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor, statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work, or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information for stakeholders:\n'State or Tribal Government\n'Disaster Number\n'Description of Disaster \n'Agency\n'Request for Assistance\n'Obligations/Estimate\n'Date Obligated\n'Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments, the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments for FEMA's Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation: The agency's preferred citation for each dataset is included in its metadata. Users should also cite the date that data was accessed or retrieved from fema.gov and/or Data.gov. Finally, users must clearly state that 'FEMA and the Federal Government cannot vouch for the data or analyses derived from these data after the data have been retrieved from the Agency's website(s) and/or Data.gov.'\n\nIf you have media inquiries about this dataset, please email the FEMA News Desk FEMA-News-Desk@dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.
